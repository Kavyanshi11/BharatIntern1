                <p>
                    In the realm of technology, I am proficient in Java, web development, and Flutter.
                     Java has been my go-to programming language. Alongside Java, I have honed my skills in web
                      development, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive websites. Also,
                      Flutter has captured my interest, enabling me to develop cross-platform mobile applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WRITING has always been my passion since a young age. It allows me to weave words into captivating poetries,
                     informative blogs, and engaging content that captivates and inspires readers. With each piece I create,
                      I strive to evoke emotions, provoke thoughts, and ignite a spark of curiosity in the minds of my audience.
                       Whether it's crafting a beautiful poetry or informative blog posts I enjoy the process of molding words to 
                       convey ideas effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my technical abilities, I am also a COORDINATOR of my college's Value Education CELL.
                     This role allows me to organize and facilitate activities that promote moral, ethical, and social values 
                     among the student community. I believe in the power of nurturing character and integrity alongside academic growth,
                      and being a part of this society allows me to contribute to the holistic development of my peers.
